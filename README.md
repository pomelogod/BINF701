Brain Tumor Classification Using CNN and Transfer Learning


This notebook presents a deep learning approach for classifying brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks and transfer learning with EfficientNetB0. It utilizes a labeled dataset containing four classes: glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. The workflow includes image preprocessing, data augmentation, label encoding, training-validation split, and model training with callbacks such as early stopping and learning rate reduction. Performance evaluation is carried out using confusion matrices and classification reports, offering a comprehensive pipeline for tumor classification using medical imaging data.
